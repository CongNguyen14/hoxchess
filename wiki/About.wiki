=== About _HOXChess_ ===

_HOXChess_ is an _open source_ [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiangqi Xiangqi] (aka. Chinese Chess) program, capable of acting as a client, a server, or both. It is a _traditional desktop_ application, mainly developed in C++ using wxWidgets library.

=== Key Goals ===

  * Documentation - Providing extensive documentation on how to build and and improve the project.
  * Reusability - Seeking to build the project based on the list of _core_ components that can be used in _projects other than_ HOXChess.

=== Help Needed ===

  * *_HOXChess needs your help!_* - No great application can be built by one person.
