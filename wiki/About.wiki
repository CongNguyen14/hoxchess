_HOXChess_ is an _open source_ [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiangqi Xiangqi] (aka. Chinese Chess) program, capable of acting as a client, a server, or both. It is a _traditional desktop_ application, mainly developed in C++ using [http://www.wxwidgets.org wxWidgets] library.

=== Key Goals ===

  * _Documentation_ - Providing extensive documentation on how to build and and improve the project.
  * _Reusability_ - Seeking to build the project based on the list of _core_ components that can be used in _projects other than_ HOXChess.

=== Help Needed ===

  * *_HOXChess needs your help!_* - No great application can be built by one. 
  * If you would like to join the effort, please contact me at _huyphan74@gmail.com_
