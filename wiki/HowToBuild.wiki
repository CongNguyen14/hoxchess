== Introduction ==

This page contains instructions on how to build [http://hoxchess.googlecode.com/ HOXChess] based on the _latest_ version of the source code.
The page's content is based entirely on my experience working on the project.

== Requirements ==
Starting from version _0.0.2.0_ (released on Nov 10, 2007), the project can be built under Windows and Linux, thanks to the cross platform portability of [http://www.wxwidgets.org wxWidgets].

  * [http://www.wxwidgets.org/ wxWidgets] 2.8.6 
  * Operating Systems
    * Under Windows
      * Windows XP or Vista
      * Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition
      * Microsoft Platform SDK
    * Under Linux
      * Any Linux distribution that supports _g++_ and _make_ packages. I have tried on the following:
        * [http://www.centos.org/ CentOS] 4.5 using [http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/ Eclipse CDT] 4.0.1, or
        * [http://www.ubuntu.com/ Ubuntu] 7.10 using [http://www.kdevelop.org KDevelop] 3.5 (as a _custom Makefile_ project or as an _Automake_ based project).

== Detailed Instructions under Windows ==
  * wxWidgets: Put the libaries and headers under _C:\wxMSW-2.8.6_
    * If your wxWidgets' location is different, then you need to adjust the appropriate settings of _hox_Client.vcproj_.
  * Microsoft Platform SDK: Make sure the paths of INCLUDE and LIBS in your Visual Studio C++ containing that of Microsoft Platform SDK (such as C:\WinSDK)
  * Open the project _hox_Project/hox_Client/hox_Client.vcproj_ inside Visual Studio C++ and build from there.

== Detailed Instructions under Linux ==
  * Go to _CChess/hox_Project_ folder and run the *make* command from there.
    * Everything is contained within one simple _Makefile_ located under _CChess/hox_Project/_
      * Once the _hoxchess_ executable file is built, run it as follows:
        * LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<_path_to_wxWidgets_libs_> ./hoxchess
          * For example: LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/wxGTK-2.8.6/lib ./hoxchess
  * *Note* : 
    * For those who develop in [http://www.kdevelop.org KDevelop], I also created an KDevelop project _CChess/hox_Project/hox_Project.kdevelop_
    * This project file is simply a wrapper of the _Makefile_ mentioned above.

== Detailed Instructions under Eclipse in Linux ==
  * For [http://www.eclipse.org/cdt/ Eclipse C++ (CDT)], the project files (_.project_ and _.cproject_) have been included under _/hox_Project_ folder in the .zip archive since version _0.1.0.0_
  * If you ever need to create a new project yourself, here is the summary of the steps:
    * Add all the source code (.h and .cpp) files to the your new project.
    * Adjust the Eclipse' s C++ compiler's setting (such as _--cppflags_ and _--libs_) based on the output of wxWidgets' s *wx-config* program.
  * *Note* : 
    * So far, I can only manage to install Eclipse CDT 4.0.1 on my CentOS 4.5 based desktop.
      * I have _not_ been able to do the same on my Ubuntu 7.10 based laptop.
